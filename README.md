1. If this is your first time here, create a folder with your name and keep all your files in that folder only.
2. Please do not make changes to any other folder. If you want to make changes to any other folder, please contact that person or post it in the group.
3. Please do not have `Dev_data_to_be_shared.xlsx` and `validation_data_to_be_shared.csv` in your folder. These files take too much memory. However, you can keep them outside the git repository and use them in your code.

* Train data and test data(internal split) is at `Lokesh/train_final.csv` and `Lokesh/test_final.csv` respectively.
